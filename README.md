# dotfiles

## packages

### look into what should be global, probably all of them since they'll make up my dev toolbox

- nodemon (as a global dev dependency...see if global dev dependencies can be part of dotfiles... might add other global node dev dependencies that can be used on any project as you find useful tools for nodejs development) (actually an npm install)

## extensions

- dotenv (vscode ext)
- eslint (vscode ext)
- docker (vscode ext)
- liveserver (vscode ext)
- quokkajs (vscode ext)
- settings sync (vscode ext)
- prettier (yay for autoformatting! dont forget to enable format on save.). also maybe prettier config file? (see nodefarm part 1 from jonas, its just a .prettierrc file, though it might just be a project by project basis) (vscode ext)
- todo highlight (vscode ext)
- pug beautify (maybe? apparently its used for building templates in node, according to jonas?)

## themes

- tokyo night (from the extensions tab)
- catppuccin (they have a github repo)

---

## general programs

- firefox
- vscode (duh. and themes: see below)
- nodejs
- postman
- gitbash (if still on windows)
- mongoDB (incl compass) (also, jonas video on setting this up locally for windows.  we shall see how this local version compares to atlas.  if atlas is better, dont worry about downloading this)
